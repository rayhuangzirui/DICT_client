# DICT_client
This is the programming assignment of UBC CPSC 317. The purpose of this assignment is to build a dictionary client using Java socket-related classes. The implementation is a subset of the client side of the DICT protocol, descirbed in RFC 2229: 
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2229

## Credits
While the DictionaryConnection.java file was independently implemented by me, all other supporting files and structures are provided by CPSC 317 staff and the CS department at UBC.
